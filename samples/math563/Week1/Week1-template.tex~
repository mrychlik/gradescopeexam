  \begin{question} (Analysis, Set Theory Review)
    \begin{parts}
      \part Carefully state the \textbf{Axiom of Choice}. Use proper notation,
      consistent with the book.
      \begin{solutionorbox}[6in]
        
      \end{solutionorbox}
      \newpage
      \part 
      Let $x_i$, $i\in I$, be an uncountable family of positive real numbers.
      Let $|J|$ denote the cardinality of a subset $J\subseteq I$.
      Prove that
      $$\sup_{J\subset I,\; |J|<\infty} \sum_{i\in J} x_i = \infty.$$
      Make sure to show the step which relies upon the Axiom of Choice.
      \begin{prooforbox}[6in]
        Let $I_n = \{i\in I: x_i\ge 1/n\}$, $n=1,2,\ldots$. Clearly $I=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n$
        and $I_{n+1}\supseteq I_n$ for every $n\in\N$.
        Let us assume that, to the contrary,
        $$M :=\sup_{J\subset I,\; |J|<\infty} \sum_{i\in J} x_i < \infty.$$
        We claim that $I_n$  is finite and $|I_n| < M\cdot n$. Else, $I_n$ would have a
        finite subset $F$ such that $|F| > M\cdot n$ and $\sum_{i\in F} x_i > M\cdot n\frac{1}{n} = M$,
        which contradicts the definition of $M$. We need two facts that seem obvious:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item An infinite set has a finite subset of any finite cardinality.
        \item A union of countably many finite subsets is countable.
        \end{enumerate}
        A set $J\subseteq I$ is infinite if for every natural number $n$
        there is a 1:1 (but not onto) function $f:J\to\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, according to the theory
        of cardinality. So 1. holds basically by definition.

        The proof of 2. relies upon the Axiom of Choice, albeit a weakened version, see:
        \url{https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Countable_Union_of_Finite_Sets_is_Countable}.
      \end{prooforbox}
    \end{parts}
  \end{question}

  \newpage
  \begin{question} (Durrett, Problem 1.1.1)
    Let $\Omega=\R$, $\cF =$  all subsets so that $A$ or $A^c$ is countable,
    $\P(A)=0$ in the first case and $=1$ in the second. Show that $(\Omega,\cF,\P)$
    is a probability space.
    \begin{parts}
      \part Which are the \textbf{axioms} of a $\sigma$-algebra? (When in doubt, follow the book.)
      \begin{choices}
        \CorrectChoice closed under complement
        \choice closed under finite intersection
        \CorrectChoice closed under countable union
        \choice contains empty set $\emptyset$
        \choice contains $\Omega$
        \choice contains all subsets of $\Omega$        
      \end{choices}
      \newpage
      \part Prove that $\cF$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
      \begin{prooforbox}[6in]
        The first observation is that $\cF$ is closed under
        complement. Proof considers two cases: (i) if $A$ is countable
        then $A^c$ has a countable complement as $(A^c)^c=A$, and thus
        $A^c\in\cF$ (ii) if $A$ has a countable complement then $A^c$
        is countable and thus is in $\cF$.

        The fact that $\cF$ is closed under countable union is more involved. First, every
        such union can be written as
        \[ \bigcup_{i\in I_1} A_i \cup \bigcup_{i\in I_2} A_i^c \]
        where $A_i$ is countable for all $i\in I_1\cupdot I_2$ and
        where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are countable.  (By reordering the sets
        in the union.) The first union is a countable set and the second set is by de Morgan:
        \[ \bigcup_{i\in I_2} A_i^c  = \left(\bigcap_{i\in I_2} A_i\right)^c \]
        which is a complement of a countable set, with one exception: when $I_2$ is empty, the
        second union is $\emptyset$, in which case the entire union is a countable set.
        Otherwise, the union can be written as
        $ B \cup C^c = (B^c\cap C)^c$ where $B$ and $C$ are countable. The set $B^c\cap C$ is
        countable, and thus $ B \cup C^c$ has countable complement.
        In all cases the result is either a countable set or a complement of a countable set,
        thus in $\cF$.
      \end{prooforbox}
      \newpage
      \part Which are \textbf{properties} (including the axioms) of $\P$, a general probability measure? (When in doubt, follow the book.)
      \begin{choices}
        \choice The domain of $\P$ is $2^\Omega$.
        \CorrectChoice The domain of $\P$ is $\cF$.
        \choice $\P(A\cup B) = \P(A)+\P(B)$ for $A,B\in\cF$.
        \choice $\P(A^c)=\P(A)$
        \CorrectChoice $\P(A^c)=1-\P(A)$        
        \CorrectChoice $\P(\emptyset) = 0$.
        \choice If $\P(A)=0$ then $A=\emptyset$.
        \CorrectChoice If $A\subseteq B$ then $\P(A) \le \P(B)$ for $A,B\in\cF$.
      \end{choices}
      \newpage
      \part Prove that $\P$ defined in 1.1.1 is a probability measure.
      \begin{prooforbox}[6in]
        We need to show that $\P$ is countably additive, as $\P(\Omega)=1$ is obvious and
        the observation that $\P(A)\in\{0,1\}$ takes care of the rest. Thus, we need to show:
        \begin{equation}
          \label{eqn:countable-additivity}
          \P\left(\bigcupdot_{i\in I} A_i\right)=\sum_{i\in I}\P\left(A_i\right)
        \end{equation}
        We consider two cases:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item If all sets in the countable union are countable, so is the union, for which $\P$ yields
          $0$. So, in this case countable additivity holds (reduces to $0=0$).
        \item If one of the sets in the countable union has countable complement then
          the entire union has a countable complement (this was already observed when
          proving that $\cF$ is a $\sigma$-algebra). We also observe that if the
          countable union is a disjoint union than at most one of the sets has a countable
          complement, as two sets of this kind must intersect. Therefore the equation
          becomes $1=1$ in this case, i.e., it also holds.
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{prooforbox}
    \end{parts}
  \end{question}
  \begin{question}
    (Durret 1.1.2)
    Let $\cS_d=$ the empty set plus all
    sets of the form
    $$(a_1,b_1]\times\ldots(a_d,b_d]\subset \R^d$$
    where $-\infty \le a_i < b_i\le\infty$.
    Show that $\sigma(\cS_d) = \cR^d$, the Borel subsets of $\R^d$.
    \begin{prooforbox}[7in]
      The $\sigma$-algebra $\cR^d$ is by definition generated by open subsets of $\R^d$. As every element of $S_d$ is either empty (thus open) or  a countable intersetion of open sets of the form
      $$(a_1,b_1)\times\ldots(a_d,b_d)\subset \R^d$$
      we have $\cS_d\subseteq \cR^d$.
      To prove the opposite, we need to demonstrate that all open sets are in $\sigma(\cS_d)$.
      As every open set is a union of counably many of Cartesian products of open intervals,
      $$(a_1,b_1)\times\ldots(a_d,b_d)\subset \R^d$$
      and every such set is a countable union of elements of $\cS_d$, all open
      sets are in $\sigma(\cS_d)$. This concludes the proof.
    \end{prooforbox}
  \end{question}
  \begin{question}
    (Durret 1.1.3)
    A $\sigma$-field $\cF$ is said to be countably generated if there is a
    countable collection $\cC \subseteq \cF$ so that $\sigma(\cC) = \cF$. Show that $\cR^d$
    is countably  generated.
    \begin{prooforbox}[7.5in]
      We can modify the definition of $\cS_d$ to only use intervals
      with rational endpoints, which results in a countabe family. As countable
      unions and intersections give us all Cartesian products of intervals,
      $\cR^d$ is countably generated.
    \end{prooforbox}
  \end{question}
  \begin{question}
    (Durret 1.1.4)
    \begin{parts}
      \part (i) Show that if $\cF_1 \subseteq \cF_2 \subseteq \ldots$ are $\sigma$-algebras,
      then $\bigcup_i\cF_i$ is an algebra.
      \begin{prooforbox}[7.5in]

      \end{prooforbox}
      \newpage
      \part (ii) Give an example to show that $\bigcup_i\cF_i$ need not be a $\sigma$-algebra.
      \begin{solutionorbox}[7.5in]
        Let $\Omega$ be at least $3$-element, and let $A,B\subset \Omega$. Let
        \begin{align*}
          \cF_1 &= \{\emptyset, A, A^c,\Omega \},\\
          \cF_2 &= \{\emptyset, B, B^c,\Omega \}.
        \end{align*}
        Let $\cF = \cF_1\cup \cF_2$. Then most of the time $\cF$ is not a $\sigma$-algebra.
        Indeed, in most examples the subsets
        $A\cap B, A^c\cap B, A\cap B^c, A^c\cap B^c$ form a partition of $\Omega$ into
        non-empty sets. Any subfamily of this family, $2^4=16$ subsets altogether, form
        $\sigma(\{A,B\})$, which has more elements than $\cF$ (only 8). Hence $\cF$ is
        not a $\sigma$-algebra.
      \end{solutionorbox}
    \end{parts}
  \end{question}
  
  \begin{question}
    (Durrett 1.1.5) A set $A \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ is said to
    have asymptotic density $\theta$ if
    $$\lim_{n\to\infty} |A \cap \{1, 2, \ldots , n\}|/n = \theta$$
    Let $\cA$ be the collection of sets for which the asymptotic density exists.
    \begin{parts}
      \part Is $\cA$ a $\sigma$-algebra?
      \begin{choices}
        \choice Yes
        \CorrectChoice No
      \end{choices}
      \part   an algebra?
      \begin{choices}
        \choice Yes
        \CorrectChoice No
      \end{choices}
      \newpage
      \part Justify the answers in previous parts.
      \begin{prooforbox}[7.5in]
        It suffices to give a counterexample to
        show that $\cA$ is not an algebra.
        The strategy is to design sets $A$ and
        $B$ such that $A,B\in\cA$  and
        $A\cap B\notin\cA$.

        The set $A$ will be a simple arithmetic
        sequence, e.g.,
        $$A=\{5\,n\,:\,n\in\N\}.$$
        The sequence $B$ will be a modificaion of
        $A$. $B=\{5\,n+\epsilon_n\,:\, n\in\N\}$ where
        $\epsilon_n\in\{0,1\}$. More precisely
        \[\epsilon_n =
          \begin{cases}
            0,&c_{2k}\le n<c_{2k+1},\\
            1,&c_{2k+1}\le n<c_{2k+2}.
          \end{cases}
        \]
        for $k=0,1,2,\ldots$, where $c_s$ is a suitably chosen sequence. In fact,
        it suffices to choose $c_s$ so that
        \[ c_{s+1} \ge 100 c_s. \]
        It is clear that both $A$ and $B$ have
        natural density of $1/5$. The two sets intersect exactly when for some $k\in\N$
        for $c_{2k} \le n < c_{2k+1}$. Therefore, if $C=A\cap B$,
        \[ \frac{C\cap [0,c_{2k+1})}{c_{2k+1}} \ge \frac{c_{2k+1}-c_{2k}}{c_{2k+1}}
          \ge 1-\frac{c_{2k}}{c_{2k+1}} \ge 1-\frac{1}{100} = 0.99. \]
        On the other hand,
        \[ \frac{C\cap [0,c_{2k+2})}{c_{2k+2}} \le \frac{c_{2k+1}}{c_{2k+2}}
          \le \frac{c_{2k+1}}{c_{2k+2}} \le \frac{1}{100} = 0.01. \]
        Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
          \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{|C\cap \{1,2,\ldots,n\}|}{n}&\ge 0.99\frac{1}{5},\\
          \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{|C\cap \{1,2,\ldots,n\}|}{n}&\le 0.01\frac{1}{5}.
        \end{align*}
        Therefore, $C\notin\cA$. The proof is complete.
